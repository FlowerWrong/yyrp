# Ruby In The Middle (HTTP/HTTPS interception proxy)

**Ruby in the middle** (RITM) is an HTTP/HTTPS interception proxy with on-the-fly certificate generation and signing, which leaves the user with the
full power of the Ruby language to intercept and even modify requests and responses as she pleases.
