## Idea form

* [NEKit](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit)
* [surge for Mac](http://nssurge.com/)
* [charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)
* [privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/)
* [ritm](https://github.com/argos83/ritm): Man-in-the-middle attack

## Test

```bash
rake
```

## Rules, see more [config.example.json](https://github.com/FlowerWrong/yyrp/blob/master/config.example.json)

* There are 4 adapters, `direct`, `mitm`, `http(https)` and `shadowsocks`.
* There are 6 actions, `http(https):http_adapter`, `shadowsocks:shadowsocks_adapter`, `direct:direct_adapter`, `speed:select fastest adapters`, `mitm:mitm_adapter`, and `reject:just close this socket`.
* There are 6 rule types, `geoip`, `domain`, `domain_keyword`, `domain_suffix`, `ip_cidr` and `other`, note: rules are in order.
